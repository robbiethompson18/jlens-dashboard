# brew: J-lens by layer and token, Qwen3.6-27B

Lens: `neuronpedia/jacobian-lens/qwen3.6-27b/jlens/Salesforce-wikitext/Qwen3.6-27B_jacobian_lens_n1000.pt`. Rank here is rank among the 10 possible answers (red, blue, green, gold, black, white, pink, gray, purple, brown), 1 = the lens prefers it to all the others. Each item's graph shows, on top, the rank
of every tracked word at the token before the answer by layer (thin = raw, thick = EWMA with a
2-layer halflife). Below it, one heatmap per word: rank at every layer (y) and prompt token
(x), darker = higher rank. Dashed boxes outline the prompt line each step reads, in the colour of the
step it produces. A word lighting up on its own token in early layers is the token echoing itself, not
computation. Correct items first.

| depth | correct |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 20/20 |
| 2 | 4/20 |
| 3 | 0/20 |
